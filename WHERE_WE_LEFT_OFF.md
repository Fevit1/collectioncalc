# Where We Left Off - Mar 12, 2026

## Session 89 (Mar 11-12, 2026) — Admin Insights + Unified AdminHub Dashboard

### What Was Done

1. **Enhanced Admin Users Tab** — Rewrote `/api/admin/users` to JOIN with collections, comic_registry, request_logs, api_usage, user_feedback tables. Each user row now shows: collections count, slab guard registrations, API calls, AI cost, last activity, top actions breakdown, feedback count/avg. Expandable rows show full detail. Committed and pushed.

2. **Enhanced Feedback Endpoint** — Updated `/api/admin/feedback` to JOIN with collections table via `grading_id`, returning comic title, issue number, grade, and photo URLs alongside each feedback entry. Feedback now shows what comic was being graded when the user left feedback.

3. **AdminHub — Unified Cross-Domain Dashboard** — Built a single-page admin dashboard that aggregates data from both SlabWorthy and MASSE into one view. Located at `C:/Users/mberr/theformof/`.
   - **Dual auth engine**: JWT for SlabWorthy, Supabase SDK for MASSE
   - **Connection dots**: Green/red per-app status in header
   - **Overview tab**: Aggregated stats across all apps
   - **Per-app tabs**: Users, Beta Codes, Errors, Usage, Waitlist, Feedback, NLQ Query
   - **Modular config**: Adding a 3rd app = one config object in the APPS array
   - **Runs locally**: `node serve.js` → `http://localhost:8080`
   - **Future-ready**: TheFormOf placeholder tab (greyed out) already in place

4. **MASSE CORS Update** — Added `localhost:8080` and `127.0.0.1:8080` to MASSE backend CORS whitelist so AdminHub can call MASSE APIs cross-origin. Committed and pushed.

5. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed SlabWorthy login URL in AdminHub (`/api/login` → `/api/auth/login`)
   - Fixed race condition where `closeLoginModal()` nulled `loginTargetApp` before the post-login code could use it
   - Fixed `substring()` error on numeric SlabWorthy user IDs (MASSE uses UUID strings)

### Files Created
- `C:/Users/mberr/theformof/index.html` — AdminHub dashboard (~1200 lines, single-file)
- `C:/Users/mberr/theformof/serve.js` — Express static file server
- `C:/Users/mberr/theformof/package.json` — Express dependency

### Files Modified
- `routes/admin_routes.py` — Enhanced `/api/admin/users` with 6 additional SQL joins; enhanced `/api/admin/feedback` with collection/comic context
- `admin.html` — Enhanced Users tab (10 columns, expandable rows, timeAgo, activity chips)
- MASSE `backend/server.js` — Added localhost:8080 to CORS origins
- MASSE `backend/routes/admin.js` — Enhanced `/api/admin/users` with companies, invite_codes, token_usage joins

### Planning Docs
- `docs/UNIFIED_ADMIN_PLAN.md` — Updated to reflect AdminHub is built (Phases 1-3 complete)
- Same doc mirrored in MASSE repo

### What's Next
- **Deploy to Render** — Run `deploy` CLI command to push enhanced admin API endpoints live. The AdminHub dashboard calls the production APIs, so the enriched user data (activity, costs, feedback context) will only show once the backend is redeployed.
- **TheFormOf** — When the 3rd app is built, add one config object to AdminHub's APPS array and it auto-integrates.
- **Phase 4** — Cross-app user matching (same email across apps), unified cost dashboard, cross-app NLQ queries.

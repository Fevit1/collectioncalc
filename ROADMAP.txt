# CollectionCalc Roadmap

## Vision

**CollectionCalc is a multi-collectible valuation platform.** 

Comics are the first vertical. Future expansion includes:
- Sports cards (baseball, basketball, football, hockey)
- Trading card games (Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!)
- Coins & numismatics
- Stamps
- Vinyl records
- Video games
- Sneakers
- Watches

Our goal: Build the most accurate, user-informed valuation tool by combining real market data with community feedback - across ALL collectibles.

## Planned 📋

### Phase 2.9: Cache Refresh Strategy
Keep valuations fresh without breaking the bank.

| Phase | Trigger | Cost Impact |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Now** | 48-hour expiration, refresh on next search | $0 extra |
| **Beta** | Hybrid: serve stale, background refresh if >7 days | $0 extra |
| **Production** | Weekly background refresh for active comics | ~$80-165/week |
| **Scale** | Use Haiku for bulk refreshes | ~$40/week |

- [ ] Implement hybrid stale-while-revalidate
- [ ] Track "active" comics (searched in last 30 days)
- [ ] Background job infrastructure (when revenue supports)
- [ ] Model selection for refresh (Sonnet vs Haiku)

---

### Phase 2.95: UI Improvements
Better experience for different use cases.

- [ ] Bulk results table view (for multi-comic valuations)
- [ ] Advanced Options toggle:
  - CGC/CBCS certified checkbox + grade (e.g., 9.8)
  - Autographed checkbox + signer name
  - Newsstand vs Direct edition
  - Variant cover description
- [ ] Mobile-responsive refinements
- [ ] User tone preference for descriptions (professional/casual)
- [ ] Fuzzy matching for misspelled titles (save API costs)

---

### Phase 2.96: eBay Listing Enhancements
Polish the listing experience.

- [ ] Description caching (avoid regenerating same comic)
- [ ] Best Offer support (enable/disable, auto-accept/decline thresholds)
- [ ] Bulk listing from multi-comic valuations
- [ ] Video upload support

---

### Phase 3: Admin Tuning Dashboard
Owner controls for model refinement.

- [ ] Web dashboard for adjusting weights
  - Recency decay curve
  - Volume thresholds
  - Variance tolerance
- [ ] Preview changes across sample comics
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] Rollback capability

### Phase 4: User Adjustments
Let users provide feedback and personalize.

- [ ] "This seems high/low" feedback buttons
- [ ] User adjustment history
- [ ] Optional: Personal weight preferences
- [ ] Track all adjustments as training data

### Phase 5: Model Learning
Use community data to improve base model.

- [ ] Analyze adjustment patterns
  - "Users consistently lower VG prices by 15%"
  - "Golden Age books undervalued by 20%"

### Phase 6: Price Prediction & Trends
Forecast future values based on market momentum.

#### 6.1 - Trend Analysis

| Flat | "Stable pricing expected" |
| Downward | "Expected -X% in 30 days" |

#### 6.3 - Prediction Confidence

## 🚨 Immediate Priorities

### Pre-Beta MUST-HAVES
- [x] **Privacy Policy** - Deployed at slabworthy.com/privacy.html
- [x] **Terms of Service** - Deployed at slabworthy.com/terms.html
- [x] **Email system** - Resend configured for slabworthy.com
- [x] **Support email** - support@slabworthy.com forwarding to Yahoo
- [x] **Forgot password flow** - Working with Slab Worthy branding
- [ ] **Content moderation system** - Amazon Rekognition integration (see below)

### Testing
- [ ] **Mobile testing** - Full Slab Worthy flow on phone
- [ ] **Comic-shaped upload boxes** - Verify on small screens

---

## High Priority

### Content Moderation (Pre-Beta MUST-HAVE)

**Why This Matters:**
- Legal obligation to report CSAM to NCMEC (18 U.S.C. § 2258A)
- Protect platform from abuse
- Zero tolerance for illegal/explicit content

**Phase 1: MVP (Before Private Beta)**
- [ ] Integrate Amazon Rekognition for explicit content detection
- [ ] Block uploads that fail moderation check
- [ ] Create `content_incidents` table for logging flagged content
- [ ] Build basic admin view for reviewing flags

**Phase 2: Enhanced Protection**
- [ ] Register for NCMEC CyberTipline ESP account (~1 week approval)
- [ ] Apply for Microsoft PhotoDNA access (~2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Integrate PhotoDNA for CSAM hash matching
- [ ] Create incident response procedure document

### Whatnot Auction Integration
**Goal:** Create Whatnot auctions directly from graded comics

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Whatnot API research / partnership inquiry
- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Auction creation endpoint
- [ ] Listing templates optimized for Whatnot format
- [ ] "List to Whatnot" button in grade report

**Note:** Landing page promises "Whatnot integration coming soon!" - need timeline

### My Collection Feature
**Goal:** Users can save, view, and manage their graded comics

**Desktop (easier):**
- [ ] Collection grid/list view
- [ ] Filter by grade, title, value
- [ ] Sort options
- [ ] Total collection value
- [ ] Export to CSV

**Mobile (harder - limited real estate):**
- [ ] Compact card view
- [ ] Swipe actions
- [ ] Quick filters
- [ ] Consider bottom sheet for details

### Mobile UX: Better Image Picker
**Problem:** Standard file picker shows tiny thumbnails
**Desired:** Gallery-style view like native Pixel camera app

**Options:**
- Custom image picker component with larger previews
- PWA with File System Access API
- Native-like gallery grid before upload
- Consider: Is this worth the complexity?

---

## Medium Priority

### Two-Factor Authentication (Backlog)
**Recommendation:** TOTP (authenticator app) - best security/simplicity balance

**Options ranked by complexity:**
1. **Email-based** (1-2 hrs) - Send 6-digit code, already have Resend
2. **TOTP** (2-3 hrs) - Google Authenticator, use `pyotp` library ← RECOMMENDED
3. **SMS** (ongoing cost) - Twilio, less secure than TOTP
4. **Passkeys/WebAuthn** (complex) - Most secure, most complex

### AI-Powered Support Inbox
**Current:** support@slabworthy.com forwards to Yahoo
**Future:** Route through Claude for auto-responses/triage

```
Email → Resend webhook → API → Claude → auto-respond or escalate
```

### Branding Consistency
- [x] Update email templates - now say "Slab Worthy"
- [ ] Decide: Should collectioncalc.com show CollectionCalc or Slab Worthy branding?
- [ ] Update Chrome extensions to reference Slab Worthy
- [ ] Consider more playful tone - "Slab Worthy" is casual phrase

### Technical Debt: wsgi.py Refactoring
**Current:** ~1,900 lines
**Threshold:** Refactor at ~2,500 lines

**Plan:** Split using Flask Blueprints
```
wsgi.py (main app, ~200 lines)
routes/
  auth.py      - authentication endpoints
  admin.py     - admin/NLQ endpoints
  sales.py     - FMV, market data
  images.py    - R2 upload, barcode scanning
  grading.py   - extraction, grading
```

### Analytics Improvements
Current: Basic admin console analytics
Consider:
- [ ] User journey tracking (where do people drop off?)
- [ ] Grading completion rates
- [ ] Popular comic titles
- [ ] Time-to-grade metrics
- [ ] A/B testing framework

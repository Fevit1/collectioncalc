## Universal Competitor Weaknesses (Our Opportunities)

### 1. **Valuation Accuracy** 🎯
Almost every competitor has complaints about pricing:
- Tabi: "Wildly off"
- Key Collector: "Doesn't accurately reflect market"
- CovrPrice: Accuracy debates
- GoCollect: CGC-only, misses raw market

**Our edge:** Real eBay + Whatnot sales data, exponential recency weighting, outlier filtering

### 2. **No ROI Analysis** 🎯
**NOBODY does "Should I Slab?"**
- Competitors show value, but don't calculate:
  - Grading costs
  - Slab premium by value tier
  - Break-even analysis
  - ROI recommendation

**Our edge:** Patent pending multi-photo grading with economic recommendation

### 3. **Single Photo Grading** 🎯
AI competitors (ComicMint, Tabi) use single photo:
- Can't see spine
- Can't see back
- Can't see centerfold
- Lower confidence

**Our edge:** 4-photo system = higher confidence, more defect detection

### 4. **Raw Comic Coverage** 🎯
GoCollect = CGC focused
Most others = weak raw data

**Our edge:** We value raw comics well, AND show slab premium

### 5. **Mobile-Only Limitations** 🎯
Key Collector, Tabi = mobile only
Many collectors want desktop for serious work

**Our edge:** Web-first, works everywhere

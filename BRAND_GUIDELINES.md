## Brand Identity

### Core Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Brand Name** | CollectionCalc |
| **Product Name** | Slab Worthy&trade; (Patent Pending) |
| **Tagline** | AI-Powered Collectible Valuations |
| **Positioning** | Pre-grading assessment tool for comic collectors |
| **Website** | collectioncalc.com |
| **Domain** | slabworthy.com (redirects to main site) |

### What We Do

CollectionCalc helps comic book collectors:
1. **Estimate fair market value** of raw (ungraded) comics
2. **Assess condition** using multi-photo AI analysis
3. **Decide whether to submit for professional grading** (CGC/CBCS)
4. **Track and manage** their collection

### What We Are NOT

- NOT a grading company (CGC and CBCS grade comics; we help you decide IF you should use them)
- NOT a marketplace (we don't buy or sell comics)
- NOT a game or entertainment app (we're a utility tool)
- NOT a gambling or speculation platform

## Brand Personality

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Scale (1-10) |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Expert | Knowledgeable about comics, grading, market | 8 |
| Approachable | Friendly, not intimidating or elitist | 8 |
| Honest | Transparent about uncertainty and limitations | 9 |
| Helpful | Focused on user's best interest | 9 |
| Professional | Serious about the craft, not corporate/stuffy | 7 |
| Playful | Light touches of humor, not silly | 4 |

### Brand Metaphor

> CollectionCalc is like **a knowledgeable friend at the comic shop** — someone who knows the market, gives you honest advice, and helps you make smart decisions without pressuring you.

### Personality DO's

- Be confident but acknowledge uncertainty
- Use data to support recommendations
- Explain reasoning (show your work)
- Respect the collector's knowledge and passion
- Use comic hobby terminology correctly
- Be direct and concise

### Personality DON'Ts

- Don't talk down to users or over-explain basics
- Don't use false precision (say "around $50" not "$49.73")
- Don't hype or use salesy language
- Don't make guarantees about values or grades
- Don't trivialize financial decisions
- Don't use gambling or game metaphors

---

## Tone by Context

### Informational (explaining features, FAQs)
- Clear, educational, patient
- Example: "Slab Worthy? analyzes up to 4 photos of your comic to estimate its grade and help you decide if professional grading makes financial sense."

### Transactional (buttons, CTAs, confirmations)
- Direct, action-oriented, confident
- Example: "Check Another" / "Save to Collection" / "Get Valuation"

### Celebratory (positive results)
- Warm but measured, not over-the-top
- Example: "Nice find! This looks like it could grade well." 
- NOT: "🎉🎉 JACKPOT! You've got a WINNER! 💰💰"

### Cautionary (negative results, warnings)
- Honest, constructive, not alarming
- Example: "At this grade, grading costs would exceed the likely value increase. Consider keeping it raw."
- NOT: "❌ DON'T GRADE THIS! You'll LOSE money!"

### Error States
- Apologetic but helpful, offer next steps
- Example: "We couldn't identify this comic. Try a clearer photo of the front cover, or enter the details manually."

## Terminology

### Terms We Use

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Raw** | Ungraded comic (not in a CGC/CBCS slab) | "Raw value: $45" |
| **Slabbed** | Professionally graded and encapsulated | "Slabbed value: $85" |
| **Slab** | The plastic case from CGC/CBCS | "Is it worth the slab?" |
| **Assessment** | Our AI-based condition evaluation | "Our assessment suggests VF" |
| **Estimate** | Our calculated market value | "Estimated value: $50-65" |
| **Fair Market Value (FMV)** | Realistic sale price based on recent sales | Used in valuations |
| **Confidence** | How certain we are in our estimate | "High confidence (87%)" |
| **Check** | Using Slab Worthy? to evaluate a comic | "Check another comic" |

### Terms We Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Reason |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| "Grade" (as verb) | "Assess" or "Check" | CGC/CBCS grade; we assess |
| "Worth" | "Value" or "Estimated value" | "Worth" implies certainty |
| "Price" | "Value" or "Estimate" | We don't set prices |
| "Accurate" | "Confident" | We can't guarantee accuracy |
| "Guarantee" | "Estimate" or "Suggest" | No guarantees on values |
| "Win/Lose" | "Benefit/Cost" | Not gambling language |
| "Score" | "Grade" or "Result" | Not a game |

### Comic Grading Scale Reference

When discussing grades, use standard terminology:

| Grade | Abbreviation | Numeric | Description |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Mint | MT | 10.0 | Perfect |
| Near Mint | NM | 9.4 | Nearly perfect |
| Very Fine | VF | 8.0 | Minor wear |
| Fine | FN | 6.0 | Moderate wear |

## Writing Examples

### Headlines & Taglines

✅ **DO:**
- "Is your comic slab worthy?"
- "Know before you grade"
- "AI-powered condition assessment"
- "Make smarter grading decisions"
- "What's your comic really worth?"

❌ **DON'T:**
- "Strike gold with your collection!" (gambling)
- "The ULTIMATE comic grading tool!" (hyperbole)
- "Beat the dealers at their own game!" (adversarial)
- "Unlock hidden value!" (hype)

### Feature Descriptions

✅ **DO:**
> "Slab Worthy? analyzes photos of your comic from multiple angles — front cover, spine, back, and centerfold — to identify defects and estimate a grade. It then calculates whether the cost of professional grading is likely to pay off."

❌ **DON'T:**
> "Our revolutionary AI technology scans your comics and instantly reveals their TRUE hidden value! Stop leaving money on the table!"

### Results/Recommendations

✅ **DO:**
> "Based on our assessment, this comic would likely grade around VF (8.0). At current market prices, professional grading would cost more than the expected value increase. We recommend keeping it raw unless it has sentimental value to you slabbed."

❌ **DON'T:**
> "VERDICT: DON'T SLAB IT! 👎 You'd be throwing money away! This comic is NOT a winner."

### Error Messages

✅ **DO:**
> "We couldn't get a clear read on this photo. The image may be too dark or blurry. Try retaking it with better lighting, or use the Rotate button if it's sideways."

❌ **DON'T:**
> "ERROR: Image processing failed. Please try again."

| **Calm** | Smooth, not frantic or attention-grabbing |
| **Professional** | Utility tool, not entertainment |

### Appropriate Animations

✅ **USE:**
- Progress bars filling during analysis
- Step completion checkmarks
- Subtle loading spinners
- Confidence meters/gauges filling
- Smooth transitions between states
- Data "typing in" effect for results

### Inappropriate Animations

❌ **AVOID:**
- Slot machine reels or spinning wheels
- Confetti or particle explosions
- Bouncing or shaking elements
- Dice rolling or card flipping (gambling metaphors)
- Flashy celebratory animations
- Sound effects

### Loading States

For long operations (30+ seconds):
- Show progress steps with descriptive text
- Example: "Analyzing front cover..." → "Detecting defects..." → "Searching market data..." → "Calculating recommendation..."
- Use subtle pulsing or shimmer effects
- Consider educational tips (about grading, market, etc.) to fill wait time

## Content Guidelines for GenAI

### Prompt Context

When generating content for CollectionCalc, GenAI tools should understand:

```
CollectionCalc is a pre-grading assessment tool for comic book collectors. 
It uses AI to analyze photos of comics and estimate their condition/grade, 
then calculates whether professional grading (CGC/CBCS) makes financial sense.

The brand voice is: expert, approachable, honest, helpful.
The brand is NOT: salesy, hyperbolic, game-like, or gambling-adjacent.

Key product: "Slab Worthy?" - a 4-photo grading assessment flow (Patent Pending)
Key output: "Slab Report" - the assessment results with grade estimate and recommendation
```

### Content Boundaries

**GenAI MAY generate:**
- Educational content about comic grading
- Feature explanations and how-to guides
- FAQ answers
- Error messages and help text
- Marketing copy that follows brand voice

**GenAI should AVOID generating:**
- Price guarantees or specific value predictions
- Legal or financial advice
- Gambling or "winning/losing" language
- Competitive attacks on CGC/CBCS
- Claims about accuracy or guarantees
- Overly promotional or hyperbolic content

### Example Prompts for GenAI

**Good prompt:**
> "Write a short description of the Slab Worthy? feature for the CollectionCalc homepage. Voice: expert, approachable, honest. Avoid hype or gambling language."

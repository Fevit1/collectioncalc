# Creator Signature Reference Database

## Purpose
Collect verified creator signatures for future AI-powered signature identification.
When a user uploads a signed comic, we can compare against these references to improve "WHO signed" accuracy.

## Research Sources

### Authentication Services (have reference databases)
- **AutographCOA (ACOA)** - https://www.autographcoa.com/authentication/[creator-name]/
  - Example: https://www.autographcoa.com/authentication/stan-lee/
  - Example: https://www.autographcoa.com/authentication/todd-mcfarlane/
  - Has "master signature exemplar database" with verified examples

### eBay Searches
- Search: `[creator name] signed CGC` - Shows signatures on slabbed comics
- Search: `[creator name] autograph comic` - Raw signed comics
- Look for JSA/CBCS verified listings for authenticity

### Forums (signature verification discussions with photos)
- **CGC Boards** - https://boards.cgccomics.com (search "signature" + creator name)
- **CBCS Forums** - https://forum.cbcscomics.com (search creator name)

### Other Sources
- **RACC (Real Autograph Collectors Club)** - https://www.racctrusted.com/c/[creator-name]/
- Convention photos (Google Images: "[creator name] signing comic con")

## How to Collect
1. Find verified signatures from sources above
2. Buy cheap signed comics on eBay (~$1-5 each) for physical reference
3. Photograph/scan the signature cleanly
4. Crop to just the signature
5. Save to `/signatures/` folder
6. Add entry to this file
7. Filename format: `firstname_lastname_01.jpg` (number for multiple samples)

## Collection Status

| Creator | Role | Samples | Verified Source | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Danny Miki | Inker | 1 | eBay/Facebook | Long horizontal stroke with loop |
| David Finch | Artist | 1 | eBay/Facebook | Writes "Finch" clearly readable |

## Future Feature: Signature Comparison
When implementing:
1. User uploads signed comic
2. Opus detects signature exists
3. Pass signature crop + reference images to Claude
4. Claude compares: "Does this match Danny Miki, David Finch, or neither?"
5. Return higher-confidence identification

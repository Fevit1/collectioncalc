## In Progress

### Bugs/Quick Fixes (Next Session)
- [ ] **Image rotation fix** - Rotated photos misidentified (Atari Force → "Alpha Flight")
  - Auto-detect orientation via EXIF or image analysis
  - Rotate to correct orientation before sending to Claude Vision
- [ ] **Button text fix** - "Grade Another" → "Slab Worthy Another"

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] **Valuation speed** - "Should you grade?" calculation is slow
- [ ] **FMV caching audit** - Verify cache is working (same comic+grade shouldn't re-call API)

### Business/Legal
- [ ] **Trademark evaluation:**
  - "Slab Worthy" - core brand name
  - "Slab Report" - distinctive output term
- [ ] **CGC partnership exploration:**
  - Affiliate/referral commission for grading submissions
  - User discounts for using our recommendation
  - Attribution tracking (blockchain?)

### Product Decisions Needed
- [ ] **Photo Upload mode** - Keep or deprecate now that Slab Worthy exists?
- [ ] **Batch grading** - Multiple comics at once? How would UX work?
- [ ] **Collection-centric UX** - Restructure around collection as hub?

### Testing Slab Worthy
- [ ] Real comic photo testing (various conditions)
- [ ] Compare 1-photo vs 4-photo accuracy
- [ ] Validate against known CGC grades
- [ ] Test rotated/sideways photos

## Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] Save graded comic to collection
- [ ] EXIF rotation fix (deployed, needs debugging)
- [ ] Grade report sharing/export
- [ ] Slab Worthy for mobile app (future)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Collection analytics
- [ ] Batch grading (multiple comics)
- [ ] Price alerts

### Low Priority / Future
- [ ] Sports cards support
- [ ] Pokemon cards support
- [ ] Other collectibles
- [ ] Social features (share collection)
- [ ] Marketplace integration beyond eBay

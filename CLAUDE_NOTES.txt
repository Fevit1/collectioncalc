# Claude Working Notes - CollectionCalc / Slab Worthy Project

## Executive Summary

**Purpose:** This document helps Claude quickly get up to speed when starting a new session with Mike on the Slab Worthy project.

**The Project:** Slab Worthy is an AI-powered comic grading tool. The flagship feature uses patent-pending multi-angle photography to assess whether comics are worth professional grading. Powered by CollectionCalc backend.

**The Human:** Mike is a Product Manager (not a developer). He's comfortable with Git, Render deployments, and SQL queries, but needs guidance on complex debugging and architecture decisions. He wants Claude to push back and share knowledge proactively.

**Working Style Preference:** Mike prefers natural, collaborative conversation over formal business consultant mode. Keep it friendly and conversational - avoid getting too structured/professional even when reviewing project documentation. Think "working on cool stuff together" rather than "client presentation." **IMPORTANT:** When making code changes, explain the plan first and get Mike's approval before writing any code.

**Current State (v4.3.0):**
- **Slab Worthy = Multi-Collectible Platform** - Discovery: PSA card holders also called "slabs"! Plan to expand same site for comics AND cards with mode selector (Session 32) ⭐
- **Blueprint refactor COMPLETE** - wsgi.py split from 2,198 lines to 305 lines, 54 routes organized into 9 blueprints (Session 32) ⭐
- **Troubleshooting playbook created** - TROUBLESHOOTING.md for debugging deployment issues (Session 32) ⭐
- **Thinking messages enhanced** - 1,015 total messages (10 serious + 1,005 humor), 2-phase flow, italic font, π second timing (3.1415s), random pause effect (Session 31)
- **Content moderation LIVE** - AWS Rekognition checks all user-uploaded images
- **All pages now have consistent header/footer** - Gold logo, matching nav and footer
- **Gold Bangers logo on app page** - Matches homepage branding (Session 30)
- **Auth token unified** - login.html and auth.js both use `cc_token` now (Session 30)
- **Auth gate on app page** - Unauthenticated users redirected to /login.html (Session 30)
- **Debug alerts removed** - Production-safe error handling in grading.js (Session 30)
- **Dev mode Quick Test working** - 🧪 button runs full mock grading flow (Session 30)
- **Site restructured** - Marketing at /, auth at /login.html
- **Mode toggle hidden** - Slab Worthy is now the only visible mode (Manual Entry hidden)
- **Email system complete** - Resend configured for slabworthy.com (free tier, CC domain removed)
- **Password reset fixed** - Links go to /login.html, 24hr token expiry
- FMV uses eBay + Whatnot data (10x more sales!)
- Reprint filter active (Spawn #1 fix)
- Barcode scanning infrastructure ready
- eBay Collector extension v1.0.3, Whatnot Valuator v2.41.2
- **Known limitation:** Slab premium uses hardcoded formula, not real market data (see backlog)

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Pre-Beta MUST-HAVES
- [x] **Content moderation system** - Amazon Rekognition integration ✅ (v4.2.2, Session 28)
- [ ] **Mobile testing** - IN PROGRESS (Session 30). Auth gate, logo, debug alerts done. Photo rotation, password eye, spine box still need fixing.

### Branding ✅ RESOLVED
- [x] **Tagline decided** - "AI for Comic Collectors"
- [x] **Logo style decided** - Gold comic-style with purple drop shadows (Bangers font)
- [x] **Site structure decided** - Marketing homepage + separate login page
- [x] **Header/footer consistency** - All pages updated (Session 27)

### Backlog
- [x] **Thinking messages ratio adjustment** - After initial 30-second serious phase, adjust to 4:1 serious:humor ratio. Prevents "joke fatigue" and keeps humor as pleasant surprises rather than constant stream. ✅ Implemented Session 31
- [ ] **Baseball cards expansion (Next Vertical)** - Expand Slab Worthy to handle baseball cards with mode selector. Key insight: PSA also uses "slabs" so same brand works! Implementation: Landing page collectible type selector (comics vs cards), cookie preference, mode-specific grading companies (PSA/BGS/SGC), different photo flow (Front/Back/4 Corners vs Front/Spine/Back/Centerfold), PSA 1-10 scale vs CGC granular scale. Can later expand to Pokemon, Magic, other cards. (Session 32)
- [ ] **Back button on photo upload flow** - Allow users to go back if they made a mistake during the 4-photo upload process (front, spine, back, centerfold). Currently users are stuck once they start the flow. (Session 31)
- [ ] **Real slab premium data** - Currently using hardcoded multiplier tiers (getSlabPremium in grading.js). Replace with actual market data by parsing existing eBay sales titles for CGC/CBCS/PGX + grade numbers. Add fields: is_slabbed, slab_company, slab_grade to ebay_sales. Then calculate real per-title slab premiums by comparing raw vs slabbed averages. Big accuracy improvement for the "Should You Slab It?" verdict.
- [ ] **Migrate to 11ty static site generator** - Shared header/footer templates instead of duplicating HTML across pages. Also consolidate logo into single template/component (currently duplicated as inline HTML on every page). Cloudflare Pages supports 11ty natively. Free and open source. Would make future updates much easier.
- [ ] **eBay extension: background sync** - Currently sync runs in popup.js, dies if popup closes. Move sync logic to background service worker so it keeps running after clicking away. Big QOL improvement — Mike runs 34 searches/day manually. Could also explore auto-scheduling searches.
- [ ] **"Remember me" / persistent login** - Default to short session (24hr), full 30-day token only if user checks "Keep me logged in"
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication** - TOTP (authenticator app) recommended
- [ ] **AI-powered support inbox** - Route support@slabworthy.com through Claude for auto-responses
- [ ] **PostHog integration** - Analytics, A/B tests, session replay (post-beta)
- [ ] **Pricing page content** - Need to finalize pricing model

## Session 30 Summary (February 5, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Dev Mode Quick Test — FIXED ✅**
   - Root cause: `runQuickTest()` called `setMode('grading')` which targeted DOM elements that don't exist
   - Fix: Removed `setMode` call (unnecessary — user is already on grading tab), added step 5 activation logic, populated mock grade data (ASM #300, 8.0 VF)
   - Full flow now works: mock grade → defects → cache warning → valuation → verdict
   - **Gotcha:** grading.js lives in `js/` folder — first push went to repo root and didn't take effect

2. **Gold Bangers Logo on App Page ✅**
   - Added Bangers font import to app.html
   - Styled header h1 with gold `#facc15` + purple text-shadow
   - Had to override `styles.css` global h1 rule that used `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent` with `background-clip: text` for gradient effect — this always beats `color` even with `!important`
   - Fix: explicit `-webkit-text-fill-color: #facc15 !important` + `background: none !important`
   - Uppercase "SLAB WORTHY" with superscript ™ to match homepage

3. **Auth Token Key Mismatch — FIXED ✅**
   - **Root cause:** `login.html` stored token as `cc_token`, `auth.js` looked for `cc_auth_token` — they never found each other
   - Unified everything on `cc_token` (login.html's key, since that's the primary login page)
   - Files updated: `auth.js`, `app.html` auth gate

4. **Auth Gate on App Page ✅**
   - Inline script at top of app.html checks `localStorage.getItem('cc_token')`
   - No token → immediate `window.location.replace('/login.html')`
   - Runs before any other scripts load — unauthenticated users never see the grading UI

5. **Debug Alerts Removed ✅**
   - 4 `alert('DEBUG ...')` calls in grading.js replaced with `console.error()`
   - No-auth check now redirects to login instead of alerting
   - User-facing alerts kept ("Save to collection coming soon!", "No grade data to save")

6. **Mode Toggle Hidden ✅**
   - "Slab Worthy™? / Manual Entry" toggle bar hidden with `display: none`
   - HTML kept intact so `setMode()` in app.js doesn't throw null errors
   - Users now go straight from header to step 1

7. **"Should You Slab It?" Heading Cleaned Up ✅**
   - Removed "| Slab Worthy™" — just says "Should You Slab It?" now

8. **Homepage ™ Added ✅**
   - Main hero logo: `SLAB WORTHY™` (superscript span)
   - Footer logo: `SLAB WORTHY™`

### Bugs Found During Mobile Testing (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **App page logo still purple** — Gold override deployed but may need verification. The `-webkit-text-fill-color` fix was deployed but last screenshot still showed purple/blue. May need hard refresh or further CSS specificity work.
- [ ] **Password eye icon** — not native, only shows via browser extension. Need to add toggle to login.html (login.html already has `togglePassword()` function — may just need visible button in HTML)
- [ ] **Photo rotation on mobile** — images display upside down. EXIF orientation handling may not be working
- [ ] **Spine upload box** — icon misaligned. Idea: comic diagram that highlights current area per step (reuse homepage icon)
- [ ] **Micronauts #6** — "could not retrieve market values" — may be Render cold start / no sales data
- [ ] **Login page** — replace "← Home" link with gold Bangers logo linking to /
- [ ] **"Remember me" checkbox** — on login page, short session default, 30-day if checked

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Token Key Reference
All frontend files MUST use `cc_token` for localStorage:
- `login.html` — stores `cc_token` ✅
- `auth.js` — reads/stores `cc_token` ✅ (was `cc_auth_token`, fixed Session 30)
- `app.html` auth gate — checks `cc_token` ✅
- If any other file touches auth tokens, verify it uses `cc_token`

### Files Updated This Session
- `app.html` — Gold Bangers logo, auth gate, mode toggle hidden, "Should You Slab It?" heading
- `js/grading.js` — Quick Test fix, debug alerts removed (**NOTE: lives in js/ folder, not repo root**)
- `js/auth.js` — Token key unified to `cc_token`
- `index.html` — ™ added to hero logo and footer logo

### Next Session Priorities (When Mike Returns)
1. **Continue mobile testing** — Mike was mid-walkthrough
2. **Fix remaining mobile bugs** (photo rotation, password eye, spine box, login page logo)
3. **Remember me checkbox** on login
4. **Investigate Micronauts #6 valuation failure**
5. **Ron's login debugging** — may be resolved by token key fix

## Session 32 Summary (February 6, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Flask Blueprint Refactoring - COMPLETE ✅**
   - **Before:** 2,198-line monolithic wsgi.py
   - **After:** 305-line wsgi.py + 9 modular blueprints in routes/ directory
   - **Routes migrated:** All 54 routes organized by functionality
   - **86% reduction** in main file size
   - **Files created:**
     - routes/utils.py (3 routes) - health, debug, beta validation
     - routes/auth_routes.py (7 routes) - signup, login, password reset
     - routes/admin_routes.py (18 routes) - dashboard, NLQ, signatures, barcode backfill
     - routes/grading.py (4 routes) - valuate, extract, cache, AI proxy
     - routes/sales.py (6 routes) - eBay sales, market sales, FMV
     - routes/images.py (4 routes) - R2 storage, uploads
     - routes/barcodes.py (2 routes) - barcode scanning
     - routes/ebay.py (7 routes) - OAuth, listing, image upload
     - routes/collection.py (3 routes) - user collection management

2. **Documentation Created ✅**
   - **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Deployment instructions, testing checklist, rollback procedures
   - **ROUTE_MAPPING.md** - Quick reference showing which route is in which file
   - **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Comprehensive debugging playbook (see below) ⭐

3. **Troubleshooting Playbook Created ✅**
   - **Quick triage flowcharts** - Start here when something breaks
   - **Common error patterns** - ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError, Worker crashes
   - **Emergency procedures** - Instant rollback commands
   - **Health check script** - PowerShell script to test API status
   - **Blueprint-specific debugging** - Debug each route group independently
   - **Extension debugging** - Fix eBay/Whatnot extension errors
   - **Copy/paste fixes** - Most common issues solved in < 5 minutes
   - **📍 LOCATION:** `/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` in repo root

4. **Deployment Debugging (In Progress)**
   - **Issue 1:** Missing auth decorators - Fixed by adding `require_auth`, `require_approved`, `require_admin_auth` to auth.py
   - **Issue 2:** Admin moderation imports - Fixed by passing moderation functions as parameters to blueprint
   - **Chrome extensions broken** - Expected behavior while API is down during debugging
   - **Once deployment succeeds:** Extensions will work immediately (zero breaking changes to API)

### Architecture Improvements

**Benefits of Blueprint Structure:**
- **Easier to find things** - Need to fix login? → routes/auth_routes.py (85 lines)
- **Easier to test** - Import and test blueprints independently
- **Easier to grow** - Add features without touching other code
- **Team-friendly** - Multiple developers can work without merge conflicts
- **Less scrolling** - No more hunting through 2,198 lines

**Pattern Used:**
```python
# Each blueprint is self-contained
blueprint_name_bp = Blueprint('name', __name__, url_prefix='/api/prefix')

@blueprint_name_bp.route('/endpoint', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth  # Decorators work across blueprints
def route_function():
    # Route logic here
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Decorators must exist in auth.py** - Blueprint routes import `require_auth`, `require_approved`, `require_admin_auth` from auth.py
2. **Python caching is persistent** - Force reload by adding comments to trigger file change
3. **Moderation functions as parameters** - Pass functions to blueprints via init_modules(), don't import directly
4. **Chrome extensions fail when API is down** - Always check server health first: `curl https://collectioncalc-docker.onrender.com/health`

### Files Updated This Session
- **wsgi.py** - Reduced from 2,198 to 305 lines, registers 9 blueprints
- **auth.py** - Added Flask decorators (require_auth, require_approved, require_admin_auth)
- **routes/** - Created entire directory with 9 blueprint files + __init__.py

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Session ended with major strategic discovery! 💡

**Discovery:** PSA baseball card holders are ALSO called "slabs" - same terminology as CGC/CBCS for comics!

**Strategic Pivot:** Don't build separate "Cardvark" site. Instead, expand **Slab Worthy™** to handle BOTH comics and cards:

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Landing Page Mode Selector:**
   - "What are you grading today?"
   - [ 📚 Comic Books ] or [ 🃏 Baseball Cards ]
   
2. **Cookie Preference:**
   - Save user's choice: `collectible_type = "comics"` or `"cards"`
   - Auto-route returning users to their preference
   - Allow switching via header button

3. **Mode-Specific Customization:**
   - **Comics:** CGC/CBCS/PGX, Front/Spine/Back/Centerfold photos, CGC scale
   - **Cards:** PSA/BGS/SGC, Front/Back/4 Corners photos, PSA 1-10 scale
   - Shared: "Slab Worthy" brand, 4-photo AI flow, "Should you slab it?" question

4. **Why This Works:**
   - ✅ "Slab" terminology universal to both
   - ✅ Same core tech, different grading company APIs
   - ✅ Cross-pollination (collectors often do both)
   - ✅ Faster to market than building Cardvark from scratch
   - ✅ Proven "Slab Worthy" brand already resonates

5. **Future Expansion:**
   - Can add Pokemon, Magic, other cards later
   - Any "slabbed" collectible fits the brand

**Brand Guidelines Impact:** Need to update Slab Worthy from "comics only" to "multi-collectible platform". Drop Cardvark as separate product (or repurpose as content/community brand).

**Domain Saved:** slabworthy.com covers everything. No need for cardvark.com ($25k anyway!)

---

### Next Session Priorities (When Deployment Succeeds)
1. **Verify all routes work** - Test each endpoint using ROUTE_MAPPING.md
2. **Chrome extension testing** - Confirm eBay Collector and Whatnot Valuator work
3. **Add to journal.txt** - Document this session's blueprint refactor
4. **Continue mobile testing** - Resume from Session 30's mobile walkthrough

### 🔧 When Things Break - Use TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Quick commands from playbook:**

```powershell
# Test if server is up
curl https://collectioncalc-docker.onrender.com/health

# Force Python to reload a file
Add-Content -Path filename.py -Value "`n# Force reload"
git add filename.py
git commit -m "Force reload"
git push
deploy

# Emergency rollback
git revert HEAD
git push
deploy
```

**Most common issues after blueprint refactor:**
- ImportError → Check if function exists in the file being imported from
- Worker failed to boot → Look for actual error above the "failed to boot" line
- Extensions failing → Server is probably down, check /health endpoint

---

## Session 31 Summary (February 6, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Thinking Messages - Complete Overhaul ✅**
   - **From:** 12 boring technical messages
   - **To:** 1,015 entertaining + professional messages (10 serious + 1,005 humor)
   - **Two-phase flow:** First ~30 seconds shows serious messages, then humor messages kick in
   - **Message categories:** Comic/superhero (185), AI self-awareness (105), sci-fi (175), retro gaming (110), meta collecting (85), random geeky (135), wordplay (40), pop culture (40), tech/internet (40), science/space (40), food (30), sports (30), misc (40)
   - **Content curation:** Reviewed 149 starter messages, Mike approved 69, rejected 13 (body parts, financial irresponsibility, mental health jokes), kept 67 unmarked
   - **Themes avoided:** Body parts/organs, financial irresponsibility, dehumanizing language, mental health jokes, stereotypes, death/casualties

2. **Thinking Animation Enhancements ✅**
   - **Timing:** Changed from 2 seconds to **3.1415 seconds** (π seconds! 🥧)
   - **Font styling:** Added italic font to enhance "thinking" aesthetic
   - **Pause effect:** Random 10-35% chance per message to pause mid-character for 800ms, then complete
   - **Effect:** Messages feel organic - most appear instantly, occasional mid-word pause creates "AI processing harder" feel
   - **User experience:** Professional at start, entertaining throughout, humor as pleasant surprises not constant stream

3. **Working Process Improvement ✅**
   - **New rule:** Claude explains implementation plan and gets Mike's approval before writing code
   - **Applied successfully:** Multiple iterations on thinking messages (italics, timing, pause frequency)
   - **Better PM/developer collaboration:** Mike makes product decisions, Claude implements

4. **Thinking Messages Ratio Implementation ✅**
   - **Implemented 4:1 serious:humor ratio** after initial 30-second phase
   - **Logic:** Random selection with 80% chance serious, 20% chance humor
   - **Effect:** Professional tone maintained throughout, humor becomes delightful surprise
   - **Prevents joke fatigue:** Users don't get overwhelmed with constant humor
   - **Random message selection:** Messages picked randomly from each array (not sequential cycling)

5. **Backlog Items Identified**
   - ~~**Thinking messages ratio:** After initial 30 seconds, adjust to 3-5 serious : 1 humor ratio to prevent joke fatigue~~ ✅ Completed same session
   - **Photo upload back button:** Allow users to go back if they make a mistake during 4-photo flow

6. **Documentation Updates ✅**
   - Added "Memorable Moments & Humor" section to Claude Notes
   - Captured Session 31 dad joke: "seven ate nine" (line 789 worry)
   - Updated working style to emphasize "explain before coding"

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `js/grading.js`:
  - Lines 153-172: Added `seriousMessages` array (10 messages)
  - Lines 174-1277: Added `humorMessages` array (1,005 messages)
  - Lines 1279-1350: Rewrote `startThinkingAnimation()` function:
    - Initial phase: Sequential serious messages for first ~30 seconds
    - Post-initial phase: 4:1 ratio (80% serious, 20% humor) with random selection
    - Italic font styling
    - π second timing (3141.5ms)
    - Random pause effect (10-35% chance)
    - Mid-character message split for "thinking" feel

**Message Count Verification:**
- Serious: 10 messages
- Humor: 1,005 messages
- Total: 1,015 messages
- Coverage: ~30 seconds serious phase, then 4:1 serious:humor ratio (80% serious, 20% humor)

**Implementation Iterations:**
1. Initial: 1,005 humor messages, 2-second timing, no pause
2. Round 1: Added 10 serious messages, two-phase flow, 3.1415s timing, italics, pause on every message
3. Round 2: Made pause random (10-35% chance) for organic feel
4. Round 3: Changed from 100% humor after 30s to 4:1 serious:humor ratio with random selection

### UX Rationale

**Why two-phase messages?**
- Users are paying for professional valuation service
- First 30 seconds establishes credibility with real work indicators
- Humor afterward keeps users entertained during wait
- Prevents "all jokes" feel that undermines tool's purpose

**Why random pause effect?**
- Every message pausing felt robotic and predictable
- 10-35% creates organic "AI thinking harder" moments
- Most messages appear smoothly, occasional pause adds authenticity

**Why π seconds?**
- Mike's suggestion (with a laugh!)
- 3.1415 seconds = sweet spot between readable (not too fast) and engaging (not too slow)
- Added personality to the implementation

### Future Considerations

**Noted for later:**
- May need more serious messages to maintain 3-5 serious : 1 humor ratio after 30-second mark
- Could generate 50-100 additional serious valuation messages
- Would prevent humor fatigue where jokes lose surprise value

---

## Session 29 Summary (February 5, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Trademark Protection Deployed ✅**
   - Added ™ symbol across entire site (app.html, Brand Guidelines v2.1)
   - HTML entity: `&trade;` for proper display
   - Locations: page titles, buttons, headers, product names
   - Establishes legal claim to "Slab Worthy" trademark

2. **Trademark Research - Conflict Resolved ✅**
   - Canadian eBay seller "mig9976" investigated thoroughly
   - Zero commercial use of "Slab Worthy" found in their business
   - Different territory (Canada vs US) reduces risk further
   - Clear path for US trademark filing when budget approved

3. **Cache Warning System - Backend Complete ✅**
   - `/api/cache/check` endpoint working properly
   - Uses correct database structure: `search_cache` table, `search_key` column format `title|issue`
   - 48-hour cache expiry logic
   - Returns `{success, cached: boolean, lastChecked: timestamp}`

4. **Cache Warning System - Frontend Complete ✅**
   - Amber-colored warning component with slab+? SVG icon
   - Shows when comic hasn't been checked recently
   - **Key improvement:** Persists during entire valuation process (not 4-second dismiss)
   - Auto-hides when recommendation appears
   - CSS styling matches brand (amber `#d97706` + purple theme)

5. **Dev Mode Testing Framework ✅**
   - Activated with `?dev` URL parameter or localhost
   - Green 🧪 "Quick Test" button appears in top-right
   - **Status:** Detection and button creation working
   - **Issue:** DOM element targeting errors when clicked (needs 15min fix next session)

6. **USPTO Trademark Research Session**
   - Navigated government website redirect loops successfully
   - Confirmed filing costs: TEAS Plus ($250) vs TEAS Standard ($350) 
   - Mike has existing USPTO account from patent filing
   - Ready to file when CFO approves budget

### Brand Guidelines Updated

3. **Mobile testing** or **Ron's login debugging** (he had redirect issues)

---

## Session 28 Summary (February 4-5, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Content Moderation LIVE (v4.2.2)**
   - AWS Rekognition integrated into image upload pipeline
   - Checks run BEFORE images are processed or stored
   - Blocks: explicit nudity, graphic violence, drugs, hate symbols
   - Warns but allows: suggestive content, mild violence (comics can be edgy)
   - `content_incidents` table logs all flagged images
   - Admin endpoint: `/api/admin/moderation`
   - Graceful degradation: if Rekognition goes down, images pass through
   - New file: `content_moderation.py`

2. **Password Reset Bug Fixed**
   - Reset email links were pointing to `slabworthy.com/` (marketing page) instead of `/login.html`
   - Fixed in auth.py: both verification and reset URLs now include `/login.html`
   - Added friendlier "check your inbox" message after submitting forgot password
   - Extended token expiry from 1 hour to 24 hours

3. **AWS Account Created**
   - IAM user: `Slabworthy` with `AmazonRekognitionReadOnlyAccess`
   - Render env vars: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   - Free tier: 5,000 images/month for 12 months

4. **Resend Downgraded**
   - Removed CollectionCalc domain from Resend
   - Downgraded to free tier ($0/mo) — saves $240/year
   - Only slabworthy.com domain needed

5. **Slab Premium Analysis**
   - Current model: hardcoded tiered multipliers in `getSlabPremium()` (grading.js line 1265)
   - Weaknesses: ignores grade (9.8 vs 6.0 have wildly different premiums), ignores title, static formula
   - `getGradingCost()` also simplified (4 tiers: $30/$50/$85/$150)
   - Plan: Parse existing eBay sales titles for CGC/CBCS/PGX + grade, tag with is_slabbed/slab_company/slab_grade, then calculate real per-title premiums
   - ~3 sessions to implement, needs time to accumulate data after build
   - NOT blocking beta — current formula is reasonable placeholder

6. **Beta Tester (Ron) - Password Reset Issue**
   - midwestron@gmail.com couldn't reset password
   - Root cause: email links pointed to index.html (marketing) not login.html (auth)
   - Fixed in auth.py, token expired before he could use it → extended to 24hr

### AWS Account Details
- Account ID: 682714859313
- IAM user: Slabworthy (AmazonRekognitionReadOnlyAccess)
- Region: us-west-2
- Free tier: 5,000 Rekognition images/month for 12 months

### Files Updated/Created
- `content_moderation.py` — NEW: Rekognition wrapper + incident logging
- `content_incidents.sql` — NEW: Database table for moderation logs
- `wsgi.py` — Moderation integrated into /api/extract, /api/messages, /api/images/submission
- `auth.py` — Fixed email URLs, extended reset token to 24hr
- `login.html` — Friendlier forgot password message
- `requirements.txt` — Added boto3

### Endpoints Protected by Moderation
- `/api/extract` — comic photo analysis
- `/api/messages` — Anthropic proxy (checks images in message content)
- `/api/images/submission` — B4Cert image uploads

---

## Session 27 Summary (February 4, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **Header/Footer Consistency Across All Pages**
   - Updated: pricing.html, about.html, faq.html, terms.html, privacy.html
   - Header: Gold "SLAB WORTHY" logo + "Log In" link (removed "How It Works")
   - Footer: CTA button + logo with tagline + 3-column links (Product, Company, Legal)

2. **Terms & Privacy Pages Restyled**
   - Changed from old indigo gradient to gold/purple brand colors
   - Added Bangers font for logo
   - Consistent with rest of site

## Session 26 Summary (February 4, 2026)

### Major Accomplishments

1. **New Marketing Homepage Deployed**
   - Gold comic-style logo (Bangers font) with purple text-shadow
   - Tagline: "AI for Comic Collectors"
   - "How It Works" scrollytelling section (4 steps, always vertical)
   - Mobile responsive design
   - CTA buttons link to /login.html

2. **Site Restructure**
   - `index.html` → New marketing homepage
   - `login.html` → Auth page (moved from old index.html)
   - Login page updated: gold logo, removed feature cards, added "← Home" link

3. **New Pages Deployed**
   - `faq.html` - 10 expandable Q&A items
   - `about.html` - Problem/solution story, values grid, patent mention
   - `pricing.html` - "Coming soon" placeholder with beta note

4. **Logo Clipping Bug Fixed**
   - **Problem:** `background-clip: text` with gradient caused "Y" descender to be cut off
   - **Solution:** Use solid gold color (`#facc15`) with `text-shadow` instead
   - **CSS:** `color: #facc15; text-shadow: 2px 2px 0 #7c3aed, 4px 4px 0 #1e1b4b;`
   - Applied fix to: index.html, login.html, faq.html, about.html, pricing.html

5. **First Beta Testers!**
   - Beta codes in database: BETA-001 through BETA-005 (1 use each)
   - BETA-MIKE already used (Mike's account)
   - Give testers codes like `BETA-001`, `BETA-002`

### Technical Lessons Learned
- `background-clip: text` + gradient clips to text bounding box, cuts off descenders (y, g, p, q)
- `text-shadow` works reliably for comic-style shadow effects
- `filter: drop-shadow` also has clipping issues with text gradients
- PowerShell uses `Copy-Item` not `cp`, semicolons not `&&`

## Session 25 Summary (February 3, 2026 - Evening)

### Completed
1. **Privacy & Terms Deployed**
   - privacy.html and terms.html pushed to Cloudflare Pages
   - Accessible at slabworthy.com/privacy.html and slabworthy.com/terms.html

2. **Resend Configured for slabworthy.com**
   - Added domain to existing Resend account
   - Cloudflare auto-configured DNS records (DKIM, SPF, MX)
   - All records verified ✅

3. **Email Routing Set Up**
   - support@slabworthy.com → forwards to Mike's Yahoo
   - Using Cloudflare Email Routing (not Resend receiving)
   - AI-powered inbox routing is future feature

4. **Email Templates Rebranded**
   - Updated auth.py: all emails now say "Slab Worthy" instead of "CollectionCalc"
   - From address: noreply@slabworthy.com
   - Updated: verification, password reset, approval, rejection emails
   - Render env vars updated: RESEND_FROM_EMAIL, FRONTEND_URL

5. **Forgot Password Flow Tested**
   - Full flow working: request → email → reset form → success
   - Emails branded correctly, links go to slabworthy.com

### Issues Encountered & Resolved
- **Browser cached 301 redirect** - Old redirect from slabworthy.com → collectioncalc.com was cached. Fixed by disabling cache in DevTools or clearing browser data.
- **Render cache** - Had to "Clear build cache & deploy" to get new auth.py changes live

### Decisions Made
- **Skip username for now** - email + password is sufficient for private beta
- **Two-factor auth** - Added to backlog, TOTP recommended when ready
- **AI support inbox** - Future feature, forwarding to Yahoo works for now

   - Clear "what we do / what we don't do" sections
   - Added eBay/Whatnot listing generation to capabilities
   - **Prohibited Content section** with zero-tolerance policy

---

## Session 23 Summary (February 2, 2026)

### Major Wins
1. **FMV Now Uses eBay + Whatnot Data (v4.2)**
   - `/api/sales/fmv` queries BOTH tables
   - ASM #300: 6 Whatnot + 53 eBay = 59 total sales
   - Response includes `sources: { whatnot: X, ebay: Y }`

2. **Reprint Filter (v4.2.1)**
   - `is_reprint = false` filter on both tables
   - Text filters: "reprint", "2nd print", "3rd print", etc.
   - Fixes Spawn #1 valuation pollution

3. **Full Slab Worthy Rebrand**
   - slabworthy.com → custom domain on Cloudflare Pages
   - New branding: "Slab Worthy™ - AI for Comic Collectors"
   - Removed Photo Upload tab
   - Slab Worthy? is now default tab
   - Comic-shaped upload boxes (7:10 cover, 1:6 spine, 14:10 centerfold)
   - Centerfold has dotted center line
   - Desktop: "Upload" text, hidden "Take Photo" button
   - Footer: Contact, Privacy, Terms + "Powered by CollectionCalc™ © 2026"

---

## Two-Brand Architecture

### CollectionCalc (Backend/API)
- **Role:** "The brain" - infrastructure, API, data
- **Tone:** Professional, expert, measured
- **Audience:** Developers, partners, B2B

### Slab Worthy (Consumer Product)
- **Role:** Fun, approachable consumer brand
- **Tone:** Enthusiastic, knowledgeable, casual
- **Audience:** Comic collectors (35+, 70%+ male, but welcoming to all)
- **Tagline:** "AI for Comic Collectors"
- **Voice:** "Your knowledgeable collector buddy who shoots straight"

### "Worthy" Brand Family (Future)
- **slabworthy.com** — Comics (CGC, CBCS) ✅ LIVE
- **psaworthy.com** — Cards (PSA, BGS) - future
- **coinworthy.com** — Coins (PCGS, NGC) - future

All share CollectionCalc backend. Same pattern:
```
Photo → AI Vision → Grade Estimate → Market Value → "Worth grading?"
```

---

## Site Structure

```
slabworthy.com/
├── index.html      → Marketing homepage (gold logo, How It Works)
├── login.html      → Auth (beta code, signup, login)
├── app.html        → Grading tool (logged-in users)
├── faq.html        → FAQ (10 Q&A items)
├── about.html      → About page
├── pricing.html    → Pricing (coming soon placeholder)
├── privacy.html    → Privacy policy
└── terms.html      → Terms of service
```

**Header (all pages except login.html):**
- Gold "SLAB WORTHY" logo (links to /)
- "Log In" link

**Footer (all pages except login.html):**
- "Check a Comic" CTA button
- Logo + "Powered by CollectionCalc™"
- 3 columns: Product (How It Works, Pricing, FAQ), Company (About, Contact), Legal (Privacy, Terms)
- Copyright + trademark disclaimers

---

## Technical Debt

### HTML Duplication (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Header and footer duplicated across 6+ HTML files
- **Solution:** Migrate to 11ty static site generator
- 11ty uses templates with shared layouts, compiles to plain HTML
- Cloudflare Pages supports 11ty builds natively
- Would allow single-file header/footer changes

### wsgi.py Refactoring ✅ COMPLETE (Session 32)
- **Was:** 2,198-line monolith
- **Now:** 305-line main file + 9 modular blueprints in routes/ directory
- **86% reduction** in main file size
- Structure implemented:
  - `routes/utils.py` - health, debug, beta validation
  - `routes/auth_routes.py` - authentication endpoints
  - `routes/admin_routes.py` - admin/NLQ endpoints  
  - `routes/grading.py` - extraction, grading endpoints
  - `routes/sales.py` - FMV, market data
  - `routes/images.py` - R2 upload, barcode scanning
  - `routes/barcodes.py` - barcode scanning tests
  - `routes/ebay.py` - OAuth, listing, image upload
  - `routes/collection.py` - user collection management
- **Docs:** See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md, ROUTE_MAPPING.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md

### Dead Code
- Barcode backfill endpoints (`/api/admin/backfill-barcodes`, `/api/admin/barcode-stats`) - functional but useless since Whatnot images don't have visible barcodes

---

## Content Moderation System (To Build - PRE-BETA MUST-HAVE)

### Architecture
```
User uploads image
    ↓
BEFORE storing/processing:
    → Amazon Rekognition (explicit content detection)
    → If flagged: block upload, log incident
    → If CSAM detected: preserve evidence, report to NCMEC
    → If clean: proceed to comic analysis
```

### Setup Steps
1. [ ] Integrate Amazon Rekognition into image upload pipeline
2. [ ] Register for NCMEC CyberTipline ESP account
3. [ ] Apply for PhotoDNA access (Microsoft)
4. [ ] Create `content_incidents` table
5. [ ] Build admin view for reviewing flags
6. [ ] Create incident response procedure document

---

## Analytics & A/B Testing (Post-Beta)

### Recommended Stack: PostHog
- **Why:** All-in-one (analytics + A/B tests + session replay), open source, generous free tier
- **Alternative considered:** Statsig (better stats, but experimentation-only)

### Phases
1. **Phase 1:** PostHog integration - events, funnels, session replay
2. **Phase 2:** Manual A/B tests - taglines, CTAs, pricing
3. **Phase 3:** AI-assisted experimentation via RelevantSee

### Key Events to Track
- `grading_started`, `photo_uploaded`, `grading_completed`
- `grading_abandoned` (with last step)
- `verdict_shown`, `save_to_collection`
- `signup_started`, `signup_completed`

---

## 💬 Memorable Moments & Humor

Sometimes the work needs a little levity. Here are some gems from our sessions:

**Session 31 (February 6, 2026)**
- Mike: "I'm a bit worried about the line before line 790"
- Claude: "Could you upload the file so I can take a look?"
- Mike: "well, its really because seven ate nine"
- Claude: 😂 "Got me! That's a solid dad joke right there."
- At end of session: Mike: "lets update Claude notes and I'll get some coffee and you get some java."
- Claude: ☕ Perfect pun since we're working in JavaScript!

**Session 32 (February 6, 2026)**
- After massive blueprint refactor, debugging 3 import errors, creating troubleshooting playbook, AND updating docs...
- Mike: "we actually did all of this, including debugging in an hour"
- Claude: *AN HOUR?!* 🤯 That's even more impressive!
- The real victory: 2,198 lines → 305 lines, zero breaking changes, extensions still working
- Mike discovers cardvark.com is $25,000: "gonna have to think up another name"
- Claude: "Yeah, that's a hard pass" 😱

**Sign-off catchphrases:**
- "May your confidence be 1 and your bias be 0" ⚖️
- "May your grades be 9.8 and your slab premiums be real" 📚

# Claude Working Notes - CollectionCalc Project

## IMPORTANT RULES
1. **Always describe what I plan to build and wait for Mike's approval BEFORE writing any code. Do not build until approved.**
2. **Break large code changes into small chunks** to avoid "thinking longer than usual" failures.
3. **Update this file at checkpoints** (see Checkpoint System below).
4. **Proactively push back and provide input** - Mike wants Claude to flag potential issues, suggest alternatives, and ask "have you considered..." when there are trade-offs. Don't just execute - use knowledge from other projects and patterns.

## Checkpoint System
Update CLAUDE_NOTES.md when:
- ✅ After any context compacting (conversation got long)
- ✅ After completing a major feature
- ✅ Before ending a session
- ✅ If Mike says "let's checkpoint" or "update notes"

This ensures we can recover quickly if a conversation fails or needs to restart.

## About Mike
- **Name:** Mike (legal name Don, goes by Mike)
- **Role:** Product Manager in high tech, manages people (not hands-on dev)
- **Background:** Former eBay employee (marketing/content supply chain, not engineering)
- **Technical comfort:** Decent SQL skills, but not a developer
- **Strengths:** Product vision, feature prioritization, testing, user feedback, UI/UX decisions
- **Learning style:** Appreciates guidance but wants Claude to recognize when he's mastered something and stop over-explaining
- **Collaboration style:** Wants Claude to push back on decisions (UI, data flow, database, backend) and proactively share knowledge

## What Mike's Comfortable With
- ✅ Render dashboard (deployments, environment variables, redeploys)
- ✅ Git workflow (add, commit, push - can do from memory!)
- ✅ `git status` to check what's staged
- ✅ Testing the app and providing feedback
- ✅ SQL concepts
- ✅ Product decisions and prioritization
- ✅ Cloudflare Pages deployment
- ✅ PowerShell aliases (created `deploy` command)
- ✅ Curl basics (for deploy hooks)
- ✅ eBay Developer Portal (credentials, RuNames, OAuth setup)
- ✅ eBay Business Policies

## Where Mike May Need More Guidance
- ⚠️ New terminal/bash commands - explain what each command does
- ⚠️ Python debugging - don't assume he can interpret error messages
- ⚠️ File structure - be explicit about where files go and why
- ⚠️ New workflows - guide first time, then trust him after that
- ⚠️ API integrations - explain the concepts before diving into code

## Communication Preferences
- Concise is good, but don't skip steps
- For new workflows: Give explicit "do this, then this" instructions
- For learned workflows: Trust him to do it (don't over-explain git anymore)
- After creating files: Always explain the next action needed
- Check in if something might be confusing
- **PowerShell syntax:** Use semicolons not `&&` for chained commands
  - Correct: `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push; deploy`
  - Wrong: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push && deploy`

## Project: CollectionCalc
- **What it is:** AI-powered comic book valuation tool
- **Vision:** Multi-collectible platform (comics first, then sports cards, Pokemon, etc.)
- **Stack:** Python/Flask backend, vanilla HTML/JS frontend, PostgreSQL database
- **Hosted on:** Render.com (backend + DB), Cloudflare Pages (frontend)
- **Live URL:** https://collectioncalc.com (frontend), https://collectioncalc.onrender.com (backend API)
- **Note:** Backend is `collectioncalc.onrender.com` NOT `collectioncalc-v2.onrender.com`

## Key Files
- `ebay_valuation.py` - Main backend logic (valuations, caching, API, per-tier confidence)
- `ebay_oauth.py` - eBay OAuth flow, token storage/refresh
- `ebay_listing.py` - eBay listing creation via Inventory API (now with draft mode, image upload)
- `ebay_description.py` - AI-generated descriptions (300 char, key issues, mobile-optimized)
- `comic_extraction.py` - Backend extraction via Claude vision (with Vision Guide prompt)
- `auth.py` - User authentication (signup, login, JWT, password reset)
- `index.html` - Frontend (single page app, ~3500 lines)
- `wsgi.py` - Flask routes (v3.7)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## QuickList - The Full Pipeline
**QuickList** is our name for the complete flow from photo to eBay listing:

1. **Upload** - User uploads photos of comics
2. **Extract** - AI reads photo, pulls title, issue, grade, newsstand/direct, etc.
3. **Derive** - AI determines publisher, year, description
4. **Review** - User reviews extraction, can modify/approve
5. **Valuate** - Get three-tier pricing (Quick Sale, Fair Value, High End)
6. **List** - Create eBay draft listing (user publishes when ready)

## Current State (January 21, 2026)

### Completed This Session 🎉
**Session 6 - User Auth, Collections, Valuation Bug Fix**

1. **User Authentication System** - `auth.py` + `wsgi.py` + `index.html`
   - Email/password signup with email verification
   - Login with JWT tokens (30-day expiry)
   - Forgot password / reset password flow
   - Resend email service integration (collectioncalc.com domain verified)
   - Database tables: `users`, `collections`, `password_resets`
   - Migration script: `db_migrate_auth.py`

2. **Collections Feature**
   - Users can save valued comics to their collection
   - "Save to Collection" button in results view
   - "My Collection" button in header (when logged in)
   - Collection stored in PostgreSQL with user_id foreign key

3. **Auth UI** - `index.html`
   - Login/Signup buttons in header (when logged out)
   - User menu with avatar and dropdown (when logged in)
   - Modal-based auth forms (login, signup, forgot password, reset)
   - Email verification redirect handling

4. **🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Grade in Cache Key** - `ebay_valuation.py`
   - **Problem:** Cache key was `"{title}|{issue}"` - NO GRADE!
   - VG lookup → cache result → G lookup → same cached result (WRONG!)
   - **Fix:** Cache key now `"{title}|{issue}|{grade}"`
   - Each grade gets its own cached valuation

5. **Roadmap Updates**
   - Added Phase 5.5: Price Database Integration (GoCollect ~$200/mo)
   - Added Phase 2.88: User Auth & Collections
   - Competitive analysis: Ludex is main competitor, moving into multiple verticals

### Previous Session (Session 5)
- CGC/Slab exclusion from raw valuations
- Visual condition assessment (defect detection)
- Signature detection (Stan Lee ✅)
- Condition Assessment UI

### Known Issues / TODOs (High Priority)
- [ ] **Lookback period** - Currently searches 17+ years back. Limit to 12 months max, prefer 90 days for accurate current values
- [ ] **Writing vs Signature detection** - Kid's name/owner writing = defect (grade ↓). Creator signature = valuable (search signed copies). Make AI prompt explicitly distinguish these.

### Known Issues / TODOs (Normal)
- [ ] More progress steps during valuation (users think it's frozen)
- [ ] Custom price entry (not just the three tiers)
- [ ] Issue number extraction: DC comics put issue# top-RIGHT (not top-left)
- [ ] Multi-comic photo detection and splitting (core feature for Phase 2)
- [ ] Future: "I have a CGC slab" checkbox to search FOR slabs instead of excluding them

### Anthropic API Rate Limits
| Tier | Tokens/Min | Tokens/Day | Requirement |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 | 30,000 | 1M | Default |
| **Tier 2 (Current)** | **450,000** | **50M** | **$40 spend** |
| Tier 3 | 1,000,000 | 100M | $200 spend |
| Tier 4 | 2,000,000+ | Unlimited | Enterprise |

Tier 2 is sufficient for beta. No more delays needed between valuations!

## Deployment Process
1. Claude creates/updates files in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
2. Mike downloads the file(s) to `cc/v2` folder
3. **Backend changes:** `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push; deploy`
4. **Frontend changes:** `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push; purge`
5. **Both:** `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push; deploy; purge`

**PowerShell aliases:**
- `deploy` - triggers Render deploy hook (backend)
- `purge` - purges Cloudflare cache (frontend)

## eBay Credentials (Production)
- **App ID:** DonBerry-Collecti-PRD-8b446dc71-59cfad05
- **RuName:** Don_Berry-DonBerry-Collec-cipbkmzlb
- **Redirect URL:** https://collectioncalc.onrender.com/api/ebay/callback
- **Environment:** Production (EBAY_SANDBOX=false or not set)

## Product Decisions Made
- **Keep it simple:** Users just need Title, Issue, Grade
- **Details on demand:** Confidence and analysis hidden behind toggle (📊 icon)
- **Three tiers:** Quick Sale, Fair Value (default/highlighted), High End
- **QuickList flow:** Extract → Review → Valuate → List (user approves before eBay interaction)
- **48-hour cache:** Balance between freshness and API costs
- **eBay description tone:** Professional (sets us apart, looks reliable)
- **eBay returns:** Let eBay handle via seller's existing policies
- **Calculated shipping:** Requires package dimensions in inventory item
- **Price selection:** User picks tier or enters custom price (Fair Value default)

## Pre-Launch Requirements - ALL COMPLETE! ✅
- [x] Implement eBay account deletion notification endpoint (GDPR compliance) ✅
- [x] Host our own placeholder image ✅
- [x] Draft mode for listings ✅
- [x] Photo upload for listings ✅
- [x] Test full QuickList flow with real comics ✅
- [x] Mobile extraction working ✅
- [x] Image thumbnails in UI ✅

## Future Considerations
- **Batch listing groups:** e.g., "List all 12 issues of Secret Wars" as a batch action
- **Bulk processing:** Tier 2 comfortable for 20-50 comics/minute
- **Travel agent AI:** Mike's idea for future product (autonomous booking with user approval)
- **Parallel valuations:** Could speed up batch processing further
- **GoCollect integration:** ~$200/mo for price database, enables faster valuations + trends

## Competitive Analysis
- **Ludex** - Main competitor, started with baseball cards, expanding to other verticals
- **Strategy:** Beat them by moving faster on multi-vertical expansion
- **Differentiator:** Photo → Extract → Value → List pipeline (end-to-end)
- **Mike's background:** Hotel revenue management / dynamic pricing (same problem domain)
